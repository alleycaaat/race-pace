# Race Pace Calculator

## Created by AC Hulslander

A web-app that will tell a user what their average pace-per needs to be in order to achieve their goal finishing time.  Created using React, useState Hook and SCSS.  First time using Hooks, created as an excuse to learn what they're all about and how they work.  (Spoiler/update: Hooks are friggin' amazing.)
